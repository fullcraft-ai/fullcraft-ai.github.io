YOLO Scanner doesn't collect or share any of your data. 
It does not even require network access.

The model files you send to it are stored locally inside the app's container, on the device only.
You can delete them at any time by swipping their cells then tapping the "trash" red button.

Some settings (like the current active model) are also stored locally using native UserDefaults 
to provide continuity in your experience using YOLO Scanner.
